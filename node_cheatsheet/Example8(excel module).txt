/read write in excel sheet(excel module)

There are several npm packages available that can be used to read and write Excel files in Node.js, such as xlsx, exceljs, node-xlsx, xlsx-populate and many more.

One of the most popular packages for reading and writing Excel files in Node.js is xlsx. To use xlsx, you need to install it first using npm:

//index.js
npm install xlsx
Here is an example of how you can use the xlsx package to read data from an Excel file and print it to the console:

//index.js
const XLSX = require('xlsx');
const workbook = XLSX.readFile('path/to/file.xlsx');
const sheetName = workbook.SheetNames[0];
const sheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];
const data = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(sheet);
console.log(data);
This example uses the XLSX.readFile() function to read the contents of an Excel file located at 'path/to/file.xlsx'. The XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json() function is used to convert the data in the first sheet of the workbook to a JSON object, which is then logged to the console.

Here is an example of how you can use the xlsx package to write data to an Excel file:

//index.js
const XLSX = require('xlsx');

const data = [
    {name: "John", age: 30},
    {name: "Mike", age: 25},
    {name: "Lily", age: 35}
];

const ws = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(data);
const wb = XLSX.utils.book_new();
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, "Sheet1");
XLSX.writeFile(wb, 'path/to/file.xlsx');
This example uses XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet() function to convert the data (an array of objects) to a worksheet. Then it creates a new workbook and appends the worksheet to it. Finally, it writes the workbook to an excel file named 'path/to/file.xlsx'


These are just basic examples of how you can use the xlsx package to read and write Excel files in Node.js. The package has a lot of other functionalities and options, and you can find more information about it in the package documentation, which can be found at https://www.npmjs.com/package/
